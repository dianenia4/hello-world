# hello-world
nothing amazing

I'm Sakinah. Ive decided to take up coding since I've got so much free time. I'm a political science major and I thought learning to code I could create an app that could be useful/enjoyable to people.  
Hoping to pick up Java and Python but currently failing miserably at Scratch smh. 
Wish me luck!!
